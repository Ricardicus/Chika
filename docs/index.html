        <h3>Experimental s-expression programming language for both PC and Arduino.</h3>
        <p><b><a href="https://github.com/phunanon/Chika">Github repository</a>: implementation source, examples, documentation, issue tracking</b>, and more.</p>
        <p><b><a href="https://proglangdesign.net/">Programming Languages Design</a>: community.</b></p>
        <p>Targets both Arduino as firmware or Linux as an executable. It facilitates high-level round-robin multi-tasking, loading programs from either an SD card or Linux filesystem.  
        Its goal is to lean toward agility over both speed and memory footprint, with a unique stack memory model, Lisp-inspired syntax, and MQTT-style internal messaging.</p>
        <p>Its spirit is: decouple everything through inter-task communication.</p>

        <h2>Rationale</h2>

        <h3>The vision...</h3>
        <p>This is the philosophy. Both I and <a href="https://github.com/thelazurite">Dylan Eddies</a> are keen on our own pocket PC's, built from scratch (within reason). <br>
        Its capabilities should enable a user to, unless there's a major update, never need to reflash their device with new firmware. Instead, be able to write, compile, and run programs on the device. <br>
        It doesn't have to be performant, rather agile and comfortable to develop on. Inter-task comms should be available to help compose complex, uncoupled systems. <br>
        It should be able to fit onto something as small as a watch to anything larger, be headless, or support multiple peripherals. <br>
        It should be able to interact with peripherals through its native programs, rather than compiled support with the OS itself.</p>

        <h4>Why are speed and memory not a priority?</h4>
        <p>I prefer to work toward its stability, agility, and ecosystem before giving any further serious consideration on its data-handling. At the moment I'm not being bashful using frequent abstractions to manage memory. <br> 
        I *think* I'm doing okay in managing stack memory right now...</p>

        <h4>Why not real-time scheduling?</h4>
        <p>Real-time scheduling has been <a href="https://github.com/search?q=Arduino+RTOS&type=Repositories">done to death</a>, and they supply <i>compile-time</i> kernels. <br>
        The vision calls for the ability to write, compile, and execute programs without the need of a second device. A simple, run-time-managed language achieves this. <br>
        Also, the vision does *not* call for real-time applications - just applications that eventually do magic.</p>

        <h4>Why use MQTT-style messaging?</h4>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT">MQTT</a> is predominant in the IoT world for directing and monitoring devices, and I find programs on a computer to be no less important. This will hopefully facilitate drop-in, many-to-many relationships of logic and data, being easier to monitor, secure, and compose.</p>

        <h4>Why no REPL, drivers, compiler, &c?</h4>
        <p>I've chosen to have the REPL, any peripheral drivers, and a compiler written in Chika, rather than a feature of the VM. <br>
        Composition of programs at runtime is its strength, and I much prefer it to messy, baked-in drivers (e.g. "this Arduino OS works with X display and pretty much only that!"). <br>
        A really nice example is <a href="http://library.ulisp.com/show?2TMA">SSD1306 support in uLisp</a>. <br>
        Essentially, other than the SD card, serial, and I/O pins, I want no other firmware-level abstractions.</p>

        <h4>Why not heap or linked-list memory?</h4>
        <p>With the 1-dimensional mind I have I realised Chika's memory can be implemented as a stack. Cheaper so leaning on C's stack, using recursion when Chika enters a function. <br>
        Using this method, global variables are not practical to implement, with immutability guaranteed. <br>
        Futhermore, heap memory on the Arduino platform is cautioned against, due to code size and memory fragmentation. <br>
        However, the lack of garbage collection and dynamic memory management means items must be duplicated on the stack before processing. <br>
        uLisp uses a linked-list for managing memory, following the traditional implementation of cells. This approach was not used to avoid re-inventing the wheel, and the vision of a leaner memory management model through stack memory. It does pay off in most cases, but operating with big data items - regularly duplicated for processing - means more RAM is required.</p>

        <h4>Why separate program memories?</h4>
        <p>uLisp, again for an example, seems to just allow saving "images" and composing them all together at start-up, sharing memory. I like it, but I like the opportunity of sandboxed areas of memory, with inter-process communication, more. <br>
        Decoupling logic through 0-to-many relationships with other programs has its benefits, especially in avoiding recompilation to accommodate new logic. Rather, programs can just assume there will be a program implementing the logic, by emitting messages.</p>

        <h4>Why a Lisp?</h4>
        <p>I like it. I've been very happy learning Clojure coming from the C++ and C# world. I feel its syntax strikes the perfect balance between person and machine. <br>
        I know other languages are more suitable for microcontrollers (e.g. Forth), and appreciate C <i>et al</i> more for what they <i>don't</i> compile into an image. <br>
        Chika doesn't include homoiconicity, native reader/compiler, macros, laziness, arity, &c., but it succeeds in abstracting away memory management and typing, and lending to simple compilation.</p>

        <h4>Why dynamic variables?</h4>
        <p>Well, it's a Lisp, and I also want to keep the compilation stage simple so it can eventually self-host. It's not too much overhead (3 bytes per item), and most functions expect only certain types.</p>
