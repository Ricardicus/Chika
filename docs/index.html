      <h2>Rationale</h2>

      <div class="blue boxes">
<span>decoupling</span><span>flash-once</span>
      </div>

      <h3>The vision...</h3>
      <p>Both <a href="https://github.com/thelazurite">Dylan Eddies</a> and I are keen on developing our own pocket PC's. <br>
      Its capabilities should enable a user to, unless there's a major update, never need to reflash their device with new firmware. Instead, be able to write, compile, and run programs on the device. <br>
      It doesn't have to be performant, but rather agile and comfortable to develop on. Inter-program comms should be available to help compose uncoupled systems. <br>
      It should be able to fit onto something as small as a watch to anything larger, be headless, or support multiple peripherals. <br>
      It should interact with peripherals through its native programs, rather than compiled support with the language itself.</p>

      <h4>Why not real-time scheduling?</h4>
      <p>Real-time scheduling has been <a href="https://github.com/search?q=Arduino+RTOS&type=Repositories">done to death</a>, providing <i>compile-time</i> kernels. <br>
      The vision calls for the ability to write, compile, and execute programs without the need of a second device. A simple to compile, run-time-managed language achieves this. </p>

      <h4>Why use MQTT-style messaging?</h4>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT">MQTT</a> is predominant in the IoT world for directing and monitoring devices, and I find programs on a computer to be no less important. This will hopefully facilitate drop-in, many-to-many relationships of logic and data, being easier to monitor, secure, and compose.</p>

      <h4>Why no native REPL, drivers, compiler, &c?</h4>
      <p>I've chosen to have the REPL, any peripheral drivers, and a compiler written in Chika, rather than a feature of the VM. <br>
      Composition of programs at runtime is a strength, and I much prefer it to baked-in drivers (e.g. "this OS works with X display and only that!"). <br>
      A really nice example is <a href="http://library.ulisp.com/show?2TMA">SSD1306 support in uLisp</a>. Chika now has a SSD1306 library of its own, controlled through inter-program messaging. <br>
      Essentially, other than the SD card, serial, and I/O pins, there will be no other firmware-level facilitates.</p>

      <h4>Why not heap or linked-list memory?</h4>
      <p>With the 1-dimensional mind I have I realised Chika's memory can be implemented as a stack. Cheaper so leaning on C's stack, using recursion when Chika enters a function. <br>
      Using this method, global variables are not practical to implement, with immutability and purity guaranteed. <br>
      Futhermore, heap memory on the Arduino platform is cautioned against, due to code size and memory fragmentation. <br>
      However, the lack of garbage collection and dynamic memory management means items must be duplicated on the stack before processing. <br>
      uLisp uses a linked-list for managing memory, following the traditional implementation of Lisp cells. This approach was not used to avoid re-inventing the wheel, and the vision of a simpler, stack memory model.</p>

      <h4>Why separate program memories?</h4>
      <p>uLisp, again for an example saves "images", composing together at start-up, sharing memory. I like it, but I like the opportunity of sandboxed areas of memory, with inter-process communication, more. <br>
      Decoupling logic through 0-to-many relationships with other programs has its benefits, especially in avoiding recompilation to accommodate new logic. Rather, programs can just assume there will be a program implementing the logic, by emitting messages.</p>

      <h4>Why dynamic types?</h4>
      <p>I want to keep the compilation stage simple so it can eventually self-host. It's not too much overhead (3 bytes per item), and most native functions expect only certain types.</p>

      <h4>Symbolistic lore</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>"Chika" is Filipino slang for <i>gossip</i>.</li>
        <li>/t͡ʃ/ is the International Phonetic Alphabet representation of the 'ch' sound in English.</li>
        <li>.kua refers to "kuan", a Cebuano word for <i>thing</i>.</li>
